{"name":"Simple-qpython-concatenator","tagline":"A simple QPython dna sequence concatenator script.","body":"This script was written to concatenate a large file (14 MB) of aligned sequences from 32 bacterial isolates. The file was in a fasta format with multiple sequences. The sequences were partially ordered in that the first sequences of each isolate were all aligned, the second sequences of each isolate were all aligned and so on. The header for each sequence began with the isolate number, e.g. >1, > 2, etc. The 'fasta file example.txt' is in the same format.\r\n\r\nThe aim was to write a simple and useful QPython 2.7.2 script. The script runs quickly on a Kindle Fire 16 GB tablet. Two output files are produced. One file contains the concatenated sequences for each isolate, the other is a list of headers in the order of which the sequences were concatenated.\r\n\r\nPaths for the input and output files need to be modified for the device the script is used on.\r\n\r\nClick on the DOWNLOAD button to use this project on your device. You will need the QPython 2.7.2 app or you could modify the script to run on other versions of Python :)\r\n\r\nIf you use the script it is your responsibility to ensure it is fit for purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
